This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android.  The `width` and `height` values might be reported as zero or incorrect during the initial render or when the screen orientation changes. This is usually because the layout hasn't fully completed yet.

```javascript
import { Dimensions } from 'react-native';

const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');

const MyComponent = () => {
  console.log('Width:', width); // Might be 0 initially
  console.log('Height:', height);
  return (
    <View style={{ width, height }}/>
  );
};
```
